# Counter

This is a simple counter application that allows you to increase, decrease, and reset a numerical value. The project consists of a heading, a numerical value displayed in a large font size, and three buttons that allow you to manipulate the value. The plus button increases the value, the minus button decreases it, and the reset button sets the value back to zero. The JavaScript code behind the project listens for button clicks and updates the numerical value accordingly. Additionally, the color of the numerical value changes depending on whether it is positive, negative, or zero. This project is a great example of how to use basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing application.
